  "description": "My set of extensions: Battery Bar, Dash Board, DateMenu Mod, Media Player, Power Menu, Workspace Indicator, Notification Indicator, Modified Quick Settings.\n\n Battery-Bar only works on laptops, on desktop it only hides the shutdown icon.\n Dash Boards shortcut is Super+d by default, however, you can change it through dconf. You can change the links aswell through dconf editor, if you want your own icon find an svg and name it theNameYouGaveItInDconf-symbolic.svg.\n You can set what source Media Player prefers, it is the players d-bus name, though the full name is not needed, but capitals matter(? im not sure), examples: Amberol, firefox, spotify, Spot.\n Disclaimer: this extension contains copyrighted icons.",
